        Starting in version 2.0, uSticker now comes with a standalone
        keyboard. In order to use uSticker, please enable the keyboard
        in the system settings.\n\n(For uSticker 1.x users, Google
        removed custom sticker support in Gboard 10.2, so we were forced
        to create our own keyboard. Sorry for the inconvenience.)

            Have too many stickers to scroll through? Put your stickers

        <![CDATA[
            <big><b>2.0.0</b></big><br>
            uSticker now comes with its own keyboard. Removed Gboard
            support and Firebase dependencies.
            <br><br>

            <big><b>1.6.0</b></big><br>
            Added an option to sort stickers by alphabetical order.
            <br><br>

            <big><b>1.5.4</b></big><br>
            Gboard now limits you to 100 stickers per pack, so added a
            validation check for that. Also removed the bug report
            button as it was encouraging spam.
            <br><br>

            <big><b>1.5.3</b></big><br>
            Removed unused storage permission. Fixed incorrect sticker
            count calculation.
            <br><br>

            <big><b>1.5.2</b></big><br>
            No longer crashes when failing to find a file browser app.
            Also added a button to make reporting bugs easier.
            <br><br>

            <big><b>1.5.1</b></big><br>
            Changed sticker keywords (for search) to be Unicode-aware.
            <br><br>

            <big><b>1.5.0</b></big><br>
            Use Storage Access Framework to select sticker directory.
            This means you can now import stickers from an external
            SD card. Also removed support for Android 4.4.
            <br><br>

            <big><b>1.4.4</b></big><br>
            Fixed crash if the configured sticker directory does not
            exist. Also reworded some text to be more understandable.
            <br><br>

            <big><b>1.4.3</b></big><br>
            Fixed index refresh failing if you have a lot of stickers.
            Again.
            <br><br>

            <big><b>1.4.2</b></big><br>
            Added support for WebP images.
            <br><br>

            <big><b>1.4.1</b></big><br>
            Fixed a bug that caused the app to crash when requesting
            storage permissions on some phones.
            <br><br>

            <big><b>1.4</b></big><br>
            Disabled the sneaky Firebase analytics that were enabled by
            default.
            <br><br>

            <big><b>1.3</b></big><br>
            Added support for Android 4.4 through 6.0.
            <br><br>

            <big><b>1.2</b></big><br>
            No longer fails if you have over 1000 stickers. Seriously
            though, why do you have over 1000 stickers?!
            <br><br>

            <big><b>1.1</b></big><br>
            You can now search for stickers in Gboard! Keywords are
            generated from the sticker file and parent directory names.
            <br><br>

            <big><b>1.0</b></big><br>
            Initial release.
